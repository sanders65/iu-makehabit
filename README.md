# Make it a Habit

An **easy-to-use** app to track your daily and weekly tasks 
to help you to **establish good habits** in your life.

I created this portfolio project in the course 
*"Object Oriented and Functional Programming"* at IU Academy.

## What is it?

With „Make it a Habit“ you can track habits whose regularity you want to improve. 
It works in an easy-to-use and simply to manage interface. 

- **Multiple individual habits** can be created. Each gets a periodicity: daily or weekly. 
- A created habit needs to get **„checked-off“** when it is done. 
A habit that gets checked-off in the defined periodicity will **„raise the streak“** 
and shows that you are doing good in establishing the habits in your life.
A habit that not gets checked-off in the defined periodicity will **„break the streak“**. 
Then you need to start again to raise your streak by checking off your habits in time. 
- Habits are **analyzable**. So you can have a look of your improvement at any time. 
For example, you can view all your habits or your longest streak. 
- Of course, you can also **delete** habits if you don’t want to use it anymore.

After you downloaded all necessary files and have installed all requirements, 
you can start the programm. 
Enter
```python main.py```
in your terminal and follow instructions on screen.

***
## Tests
To run the tests, pytest needs to be installed.
Then run: 
```pytest .```

Example habit and tracking data can be found in 
```main.db```.

## Acknowledgement
Being a beginner at programming, I thought I can't accomplish a project like this. 
But: In the end, I finally made it work (at least I think so). Yeahs to that!
